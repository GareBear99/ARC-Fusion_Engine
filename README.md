# ARC-Core

**The authoritative event-and-receipt engine for the ARC governed-AI ecosystem — a deterministic kernel for signal intelligence, entity resolution, graph state, case management, proposal workflows, geospatial overlays, and authority-gated execution.**

> Every receipt in the ARC ecosystem derives from ARC-Core's discipline. Inspired by ARC-OS (2067) from *Continuum*, built as the system-of-record layer that every other ARC repo can sign its decisions against.

<sub>**Topics**: signal intelligence · event sourcing · receipt chains · cognitive architecture · deterministic systems · case management · geospatial intelligence · FastAPI · SQLite · authority gating · ARC ecosystem · governed AI · operator console · Proto-AGI infrastructure</sub>

## 🌐 The ARC Ecosystem

ARC-Core is **the root authority** in a seven-repo governed-AI ecosystem. Every other repo depends on the event-and-receipt discipline defined here.

### Where ARC-Core is used, and for what

| Repo | What it uses ARC-Core for |
|---|---|
| **[arc-lucifer-cleanroom-runtime](https://github.com/GareBear99/arc-lucifer-cleanroom-runtime)** | The deterministic kernel hosts its event log on ARC-Core semantics: every state transition is a proposal → evidence → receipt chain, replayable via `state_at(event_id)`. Cleanroom is where ARC-Core's discipline becomes runtime enforcement. |
| **[arc-cognition-core](https://github.com/GareBear99/arc-cognition-core)** | Every training run, benchmark result, and promotion decision in the cognition lab becomes an ARC-Core-style event. Promotion gate v1 (the lineage that became LLMBuilder's Gate v2) uses ARC-Core's authority-gating pattern for who may promote what. |
| **[ARC-Neuron-LLMBuilder](https://github.com/GareBear99/ARC-Neuron-LLMBuilder)** | Every Gate v2 promotion receipt is an ARC-Core-shaped event — candidate, incumbent, evidence, decision, SHA-256 identity. Conversation turns through the canonical pipeline are the same kind of event-with-receipt that ARC-Core pioneered. |
| **[arc-language-module](https://github.com/GareBear99/arc-language-module)** | Language absorption, self-fill, arbitration, and release snapshots all use ARC-Core's provenance-and-approval flow: proposed term → evidence (source, trust rank) → receipt → approved canon. Contradiction handling mirrors ARC-Core's dual-record discipline. |
| **[omnibinary-runtime](https://github.com/GareBear99/omnibinary-runtime)** | Binary intake / classification / execution-fabric events flow into the OBIN ledger using ARC-Core's receipt-first doctrine. Every binary operation produces a receipt *before* producing a result, mirroring ARC-Core's event-sourcing stance. |
| **[Arc-RAR](https://github.com/GareBear99/Arc-RAR)** | Archive bundles and restorable extracts are event-producing. Extraction leaves an ARC-Core-style receipt; bundle manifests carry SHA-256 identity that ARC-Core's receipt chain can verify against. |

All seven repos share one author and one funding target: [github.com/sponsors/GareBear99](https://github.com/sponsors/GareBear99).

Full per-repo integration contracts: [**ECOSYSTEM.md**](./ECOSYSTEM.md).

### And beyond the core ecosystem — consumer applications using ARC-Core

ARC-Core's discipline is also used as the authority/receipt backbone for several consumer applications, games, simulators, and commercial product backends. Each of these repos carries its own **🔐 Built on ARC-Core** section with a per-project pattern-mapping table.

| Application | Repository | What it uses ARC-Core for |
|---|---|---|
| **🎮 Rift Ascent** | [RiftAscent](https://github.com/GareBear99/RiftAscent) | Player-event ledger (moves, kills, prestige cycles, upgrades), receipt-verified co-op sessions, tamper-evident high-score chain, deterministic game-state replay via event sourcing, anti-cheat audit trail |
| **🌌 Seeded Universe Recreation Engine** | [Seeded-Universe-Recreation-Engine](https://github.com/GareBear99/Seeded-Universe-Recreation-Engine) | Ships `ARC_Console/` **inside the repo** — live FastAPI integration. Seed receipts for every universe-generation event, entity-resolution pattern for celestial objects, deterministic event log for simulation replay, authority over "this seed produced this universe" |
| **🎨 Proto-Synth Grid Engine** | [Proto-Synth_Grid_Engine](https://github.com/GareBear99/Proto-Synth_Grid_Engine) | Carries an `ARC_CORE_AUDIT_v44.txt` audit artifact. Blueprint events, grid mutations, module attachment, simulation-loop tick receipts, save-file event logs, Voxel/Neural-Synth sync, authority-gated mutations, audit trail |
| **🔭 Neo-VECTR Solar Sim (NASA Standard)** | [Neo-VECTR_Solar_Sim_NASA_Standard](https://github.com/GareBear99/Neo-VECTR_Solar_Sim_NASA_Standard) | Truth-pack receipt chain (every celestial object has provenance), event-sourced navigation, authority over what counts as "proven" (NASA standard), deterministic universe-graph replay |
| **🎵 TizWildin Entertainment Hub** | [TizWildinEntertainmentHUB](https://github.com/GareBear99/TizWildinEntertainmentHUB) | **Entire plugin-ecosystem backend** — entitlement receipts (who owns which plugin), seat-assignment audit trail, Stripe billing event log, GitHub release-polling event chain, authority-gated activation, support-case management, and orchestration for **14 JUCE audio plugins** (FreeEQ8, PaintMask, WURP, AETHER, WhisperGate, Therum, Instrudio, BassMaid, SpaceMaid, GlueMaid, MixMaid, ChainMaid, RiftWave Suite, FreeSampler) |

ARC-Core is the authority backbone for **all** of the above. Every player action, seed event, grid mutation, celestial fact, plugin activation, and billing transaction is an ARC-Core-shaped event with a receipt.

## What ARC-Core is

ARC-Core is a structured intelligence-console foundation built around:

- **Canonical events** — every meaningful state change is a typed event with a SHA-256 identity
- **Replayable state transitions** — derive state by replaying events; never mutate in place
- **Entity and graph tracking** — resolved identities, relationships, temporal evolution
- **Proposal workflows** — nothing takes effect without proposal → evidence → authority → receipt
- **Case management** — analyst investigations bind events, entities, notes, and proposals
- **Tamper-evident receipts** — signed, hash-chained, verifiable audit trail
- **Authority-gated actions** — role-based dependency injection at every sensitive endpoint
- **Geospatial overlays** — structures, sensors, geofences, blueprints, calibration, tracks, incidents
- **Evidence export** — portable, replayable evidence packs for investigations or audits

**Not** a chat wrapper. **Not** a freeform agent shell. **Not** a pile of loose scripts. ARC-Core is the kernel that every operator surface, visualization layer, autonomous runtime, archive system, and cognition interface in the ARC ecosystem is meant to sit on top of.

## ⚖️ What makes ARC-Core different

Most "AI agent" repos start with a model and improvise the rest. **ARC-Core starts with state, schema, auditability, replay, receipts, bounded execution, approval lanes, and evidence.** That makes it useful for:

- Signal intelligence consoles
- Deterministic agent infrastructure
- Operator dashboards
- Case and proposal systems
- Geospatial incident tracking
- Structured memory backbones
- Future synthetic cognition runtimes
- Authority layer for any system that needs "did X actually happen, signed by whom, verifiable by hash"

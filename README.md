# ARC

**Adaptive Reasoning Core** — a deterministic event kernel for signal intake, proposal flow, state tracking, branch simulation, and authority-gated execution.

This repository is the early ARC signal-intelligence scaffold: a lightweight foundation for ingesting entities and relationships, storing signal history, detecting spikes, exposing basic API routes, and rendering a minimal console surface. It is the beginning of a much larger architecture where ARC becomes the canonical kernel underneath future systems such as Lucid Terminal, Synth visualization, and proposal-driven worker execution.

## Origins & Inspiration

ARC is conceptually modeled after the **ARC worldwide information surveillance / coordination system** depicted in **Continuum**, the sci-fi series set against a heavily surveilled **2077-era future**.

In that fiction, ARC represents a global intelligence layer that can:

- ingest massive streams of world information
- correlate entities, events, and threat signals
- surface guidance and operational insight in real time
- function as a persistent coordination and surveillance backbone

This repository is **not a direct recreation of the fictional system**. It is a real-world infrastructure experiment inspired by the same core idea:

> build an auditable, structured, deterministic intelligence core that can observe signals, track state, propose actions, and gate execution under authority.

Where the fictional ARC is cinematic and all-encompassing, this ARC is being built as an engineering system with:

- explicit schemas
- replayable transitions
- receipts and validation
- bounded workers
- human-supervised execution
- optional model augmentation instead of model authority

---

## What ARC is

ARC is being built as an **infrastructure-first cognition engine**, not just another chat wrapper.

The long-term role of ARC is to provide:

- deterministic intake and processing of events
- canonical event schema and receipt logging
- proposal lifecycle handling
- replayable state transitions
- branch simulation and rollback support
- bounded worker execution with proof bundles
- authority-gated actions instead of freeform model control
- an event-memory graph that can outlive any single language model

In that architecture, language models are optional augmenters. ARC remains the stable core.

---

## Current repository scope

The current package is a **minimal signal console prototype**. It includes:

- a queue-driven worker loop
- an in-memory signal store for entities and relationships
- a signal engine that records observed entities and edges
- a simple trend detector for recent spike detection
- a source influence weighting stub
- a FastAPI route for reading entity signal history
- basic HTML console pages for dashboard and signal monitoring

This means the repo is currently a **kernel seed / scaffold**, not the full ARC vision yet.

## Core modules

### `worker_engine.py`
Simple queue consumer that continuously pops items and runs them through a pipeline.

### `arc/signals/signal_store.py`
In-memory storage for:
- entity timestamps
- relationship timestamps

### `arc/signals/signal_engine.py`
Records entities and relationships into the signal store.

### `arc/signals/trend_detector.py`
Basic spike detector that flags when enough events occur inside a time window.

### `arc/signals/influence_engine.py`
Weighting stub for source priority / trust / impact.

### `arc/api/signals_api.py`
FastAPI route for fetching stored signal data by entity.

### `ui/dashboard.html`
Minimal dashboard shell for future ARC console expansion.

### `ui/signals.html`
Simple signal monitor page that fetches signal data from the API.

## ARC philosophy

Most AI systems today are built backward:
- model first
- infrastructure second
- determinism optional
- memory fragile
- action safety bolted on later

ARC is being built the opposite way:
- canonical state first
- deterministic handling first
- replay and audit first
- worker bounds first
- authority and validation first
- model assistance later

That makes ARC suitable for:
- intelligence consoles
- business operations engines
- agent systems with constrained execution
- signal/event monitoring
- timeline reconstruction
- proposal and receipt systems
- future synthetic cognition layers

## Long-term target architecture

Canonical Event Schema
        ↓
Proposal Lifecycle
        ↓
Receipt Ledger
        ↓
State Tree
        ↓
Branch Engine
        ↓

Proof Bundles
        ↓
Replay / Rollback

```

This repo is an early step toward that system.

## Relationship to the wider stack

ARC is the kernel layer in a larger system direction:

```text
ARC
│
├── Lucid Terminal
│   deterministic operator interface
│
├── Synth
│   visualization / embodiment layer
│
└── Future ARC-native cognition layer
    structured reasoning augmentation without canonical state authority
```

ARC owns:

- truth handling
- canonical state
- proposals
- validation
- receipts
- branchable decision paths
- execution authority boundaries

Other layers may visualize, assist, or propose — but ARC remains the system of record.

---

## Planned next upgrades

Recommended next implementation order:

1. **Canonical event schema**
   - typed event envelope
   - IDs, timestamps, actor/source, payload, signature fields

2. **Receipt ledger**
   - append-only journal for accepted actions and state transitions

3. **Proposal model**
   - proposed → validated → approved → executed → receipted lifecycle

4. **State tree**
   - explicit deterministic state snapshots and transition handlers

5. **Branch engine**
   - simulate alternate outcomes without mutating canonical state

6. **Worker contract**
   - bounded execution rules, receipts, artifacts, proof bundles

7. **Console expansion**
   - signal graphs
   - event radar
   - state explorer
   - receipt timeline
   - branch comparison UI

8. **Persistence layer**
   - replace in-memory storage with durable backing store

9. **Validation + policy layer**
   - authority gating
   - policy rules
   - non-fatal/fatal violation surfaces

10. **Synth integration**
   - visual state projection only
   - no execution authority in the visual layer

## Project goal

ARC explores how to build a **real-world deterministic intelligence framework** inspired by fictional systems like the ARC network in *Continuum*, while remaining transparent, auditable, replayable, and developer-controlled.

The long-term target is not “a chatbot with memory.”

It is:

- a signal and event kernel
- a proposal and validation engine
- a truth/state authority layer
- a branch simulation system
- a foundation for future structured machine cognition

In plain terms: **ARC is intended to become the core system that watches, understands, proposes, validates, and records — before anything acts.**
